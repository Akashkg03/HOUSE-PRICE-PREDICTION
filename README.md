## House Price Prediction
#### Problem Statement:
- The main objective of this project is to build a model that predict the housing prices in California using the California census data.
#### Methodology:
- Utilized a regression-based machine learning approach to predict housing prices.
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling,feature extraction and encoding categorical variables.
- Explored various regression algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, knn, svr, random forests, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting and XG boost.
#### Results:
- Achieved a root mean squared error (MSE) of 40000 on the test dataset, indicating the model's ability to predict housing prices.
#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Data preprocessing, data visualization, regression modeling, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation.
#### Technologies Used:
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
